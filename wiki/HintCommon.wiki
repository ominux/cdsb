= Using RC Script =

If the rc script is needed. Put it in the `/compat/linux/etc/rcCDS.d` directory.

The `/compat/linux/etc/rcCDS.d` directory contains rc scripts of Cadence products. File names in `/compat/linux/etc/rcCDS.d` are of the form `S??*` or the form `K??*` where `S` means start this script, `K` means kill this script, and `??` is the relative sequence number for starting or killing the script.

At system boot, the `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/cdsrc` script executes those scripts in `/compat/linux/etc/rcCDS.d` that are prefixed with `S`. At system shutdown, the `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/cdsrc` script executes those scripts in `/compat/linux/etc/rcCDS.d` that are prefixed with `K`.

When executing each script in `/compat/linux/etc/rcCDS.d`, the `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/cdsrc` script passes a single argument. It passes the argument `start` for scripts prefixed with `S` and the argument `stop` for scripts prefixed with `K`.

= Installing Java Runtime Environment^TM^ =

If the Java Runtime Environment^TM^ for Linux® does not run correctly on FreeBSD, install the other version of the Java Runtime Environment from Ports, then create a link to point to it.

= Using Linux Shell =

If a Linux Binaries does not run, type:

 `brandelf -t Linux` _`linux_elf_binary`_
