Introduction
------------

This is CDSB version 1.1.2. If a previous version has been installed, remove it
then use this version.

FreeBSD provides the binary compatibility with Linux, therefor some Cadence
products for Linux can be installed on FreeBSD.

CDSB makes the necessary preparations for the installation of Cadence products
on FreeBSD.

Requirements
------------

1. Operating System

    FreeBSD i386

2. Network Connection

    Need Network Connection to install Ports and RPMs.

3. The Ports Collection

    The Ports tree must be installed or updated.

Usage
-----

1. Login as root.

2. Unpack the archives. Type:

    gzip -cd cdsb_1.1.2.tar.gz | tar xvf -

3. Run CDSB. Type:

    ./cdsb_1.1.2/bin/cdsb

Recommendation
--------------

1. Installing Java Runtime Environment

    Cadence products usually contains the Java Runtime Environment. If it does
    not run correctly on FreeBSD, install the other version of the Java
    Runtime Environment, then create a link to point to it.

    For example, the Cadence installation program InstallScape contains the
    Java Runtime Environment in the iscape/runtime directory, named LNX86. To
    create a link, Type:

	mv LNX86 LNX86_sorry
	ln -s path_to_jre LNX86

    The path_to_jre directory is another Java Runtime Environment installation
    directory.

    In addition, if the use of installscape encounter any accidents, try using
    the batch mode.

2. Using Linux Shell

    To use Cadence products, Linux Shells are essential, for example,
    /compat/linux/bin/sh. Create an account that uses the Linux shell is
    recommended.

    To use the C shell, /compat/linux/bin/csh and /compat/linux/bin/tcsh, in
    order to locate the root directory correctly, add following to ~/.cshrc or
    ~/.tcshrc:

	set path=( $path \
		   /../sbin \
		   /../bin \
		   /../usr/sbin \
		   /../usr/bin \
		   /../usr/games \
		   /../usr/local/sbin \
		   /../usr/local/bin \
		   /../usr/X11R6/bin \
		 )

3. Using RC Script

    Cadence products provides several rc scripts to start daemons, for example,
    the license daemons. CDSB creates the /compat/linux/etc/rcCDS.d directory,
    put rc scripts in this directory. See the /compat/linux/etc/rcCDS.d/README
    file for details.

4. Environment Variable

    An environment variable CDSB_UNAME_M has been set as 'i386'. If HSPICE not
    installed, this environment variable should be unset.

	~/.profile:

	    unset CDSB_UNAME_M

	~/.cshrc:

	    unsetenv CDSB_UNAME_M

    The environment variable LIBXCB_ALLOW_SLOPPY_LOCK has been set as '1'.
